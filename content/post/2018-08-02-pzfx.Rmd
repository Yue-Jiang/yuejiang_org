Back in the early days of grad school I used to use Prism GraphPad a lot before switching to R. Prism is a great piece of software and I've seen scientists using them a lot. Recently I wanted to import a Prism `.pzfx` file into R, and as usual, I went to Google expecting there'll be some `readxl` or `readr` equivalent for prism. Surprisingly, I didn't find much more than [this SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25506099/r-import-xml-from-graphpad-prism). So, how do you import a prism file into R? The easiest way is probably exporting the prism file to a text file then read it into R. But this just doesn't feel that good, right? So I started looking into the file structure of `.pzfx` files and tried to parse it by myself. Starting from Prism5, in addition to the binary file it also stores the data table in XML format which is possible to parse. After some trials and errors I made a little [R package](https://github.com/Yue-Jiang/pzfx) to read `.pzfx` files into R data frames. I'll briefly document how it works here.

# Example Prism files

As an example, I obtained some `.pzfx` files from [this paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/19535). The file for Fig 1 looks like this:  ![data1](/post/2018-08-02-pzfx_files/elife-19535-fig1-data1-v1.png){width=100%}

# Main functionality

List tables from a `.pzfx` file:

```{r}
library(pzfx)
pzfx_tables("../../static/data/benoit_elife_2017/elife-19535-fig1-data1-v1.pzfx")
```

Read one specific table into R:

```{r}
df1 <- read_pzfx("../../static/data/benoit_elife_2017/elife-19535-fig1-data1-v1.pzfx", table="relative larval obp6 expression")
```

`NA`s will be added if the columns are of different lengths.

```{r}
df1
```

# Additional features

Prism allows user to strike out data. To accommodate this, an option `strike_action` is available in `read_pzfx`. One can choose to delete these values with `strike_action="exclude"`, keep them with `"keep"`, or convert them to a trailing "*" with `"star"`. Note if `strike_action="star"` the entire table will be converted to type `character`. 

Special formating of column names such as superscripts will be converted to regular strings.

For example (I striked out data myself from the original table) when the input looks like this:
![data2](/post/2018-08-02-pzfx_files/elife-19535-fig2-data1-v1_modified.png){width=100%}

```{r}
df2_e <- read_pzfx("../../static/data/benoit_elife_2017/elife-19535-fig2-data1-v1_modified.pzfx",
                   table=1,
                   strike_action="exclude")
df2_e
```

```{r}
df2_k <- read_pzfx("../../static/data/benoit_elife_2017/elife-19535-fig2-data1-v1_modified.pzfx",
                   table=1,
                   strike_action="keep")
df2_k
```

```{r}
df2_s <- read_pzfx("../../static/data/benoit_elife_2017/elife-19535-fig2-data1-v1_modified.pzfx",
                   table=1,
                   strike_action="star")
df2_s
```

Like Excel, Prism also allows subcolumns. For example, you can have replicates in subcolumns:
![data3](/post/2018-08-02-pzfx_files/elife-19535-fig2-data3-v1.png){width=100%}

`read_pzfx` will automatically add `_1`, `_2` etc to the original column name to account for sub columns if they are replicates.

```{r}
df3 <- read_pzfx("../../static/data/benoit_elife_2017/elife-19535-fig2-data3-v1.pzfx")
df3
```

But also you can have subcolumns to mean different things, for example the first is the mean, second standard deviation, third the number of observations.
![data3_modified](/post/2018-08-02-pzfx_files/elife-19535-fig2-data3-v1_modified.png){width=100%}

In this case, trailing `_MEAN`, `_SD`, `_N` will be added.

```{r}
df3_mod <- read_pzfx("../../static/data/benoit_elife_2017/elife-19535-fig2-data3-v1_modified.pzfx")
df3_mod
```

Currently `read_pzfx` works for all these alternative subcolumn types by Prism7:
